Information:
    Vulnerability Type: use-of-uninitialized-variable
    Crash/Trigger Point(s): line 5 in example.c, line 6 in example.c

    Relevant Source Code:
    In example.c:
    line 1    #include <stdio.h>
    line 2
    line 3    void foo() {
    line 4        int a, b, c, d;
    line 5        int v = sscanf(input.field,"%d.%d.%d.%d",&a,&b,&c,&d);
    line 6        use(b);
    line 7    }

Steps for triggering condition generation:
    1. Identify and output each conditional statement along with its code location.
        v < 2, line 6 in example.c (line 6 means the conditional statement should already be satisfied when executing line 6)
    2. If multiple conditional statements across different locations are required, assign an execution order to each group.
        v < 2, line 6 in example.c, 0 (0 means executed 1st)
    3. For any complex conditional statements, decompose them into atomic conditional statements, and assign a conjunct identifier to each one for later reconstruction.
        v < 2, line 6 in example.c, 0, 0 (we first convert the target conditional statement into its Disjunctive Normal Form. The resulting DNF consists of n conjuncts, each representing a set of AND operations between primitive sub-conditions. Within this framework, the element conj serves as an identifier specifying the originating conjunct i for each primitive condition, 0 means the first conjunct)
    4. Finally, output all triggering conditions in the form of tuples: <cond, loc, seq, conj>
        <v < 2, line 6 in example.c, 0, 0>
